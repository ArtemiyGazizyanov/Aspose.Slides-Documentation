## **Adding Picture Frame to the Slide**
{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Picture frame is also one of the shapes offered by Aspose.Slides for Java. Adding picture frame to a slide is bit trickier than simple shapes. A picture frame is like a picture in a frame. You can add any desired picture to your slide as a picture frame. Let's see, how can we do it.

{{% /alert %}} 

This article explains how picture frames can be used in different ways:
### **Adding Simple Picture Frame to the Slide**
To add a simple picture frame to your slide, please follow the steps below:

1. Create an instance of the [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
1. Obtain the reference of a slide by using its index.
1. Create an **Image** object by adding an image to the **Images** collection associated with the [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) object that will be used to fill the **Shape**.
1. Calculate the width and height of the image.
1. Create a [PictureFrame](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/PictureFrame) according to the width and height of the image by using the **addPictureFrame** method exposed by the **Shapes** object associated with the referenced slide.
1. Add a picture frame (containing the picture) to the slide.
1. Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

The above steps are implemented in the example given below.

## **Working with OLE Object Frames**
{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

OLE stands for **Object Linking & Embedding**. It's a Microsoft technology that allows objects created in one application to be embedded in another application. For example, you can create a chart in an Excel Worksheet and then embed that chart object into your PowerPoint slide. After the chart object is embedded, you just double click the object and the chart object will be opened in editable form as you see in MS Excel. Aspose.Slides for Java supports adding OLE Objects to the slides in the form of **OLE Object Frames**. In this topic, we will work with **OLE Object Frames** to see that how can we add and access these objects to and from slides using Aspose.Slides for Java.

{{% /alert %}} 

This article explains different examples of working with Ole frames:
### **Adding an OLE Object Frame to the Slide**
Suppose, you have created a **Microsoft Excel Chart** in an Excel file and want to embed that chart object in a slide as an **OLE Object Frame** using Aspose.Slides for Java. Then you can do that using the steps below:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Open the Excel file containing Microsoft Excel Chart object and save it to MemoryStream.
- Add the OLE Object Frame to the slide containing the array of bytes and other information about the OLE object.
- Write the modified presentation as a PPTX file.

In the example given below, a **Microsoft Excel Chart** object in an Excel file is added to a slide as an **OLE Object Frame** using Aspose.Slides for Java.

{{< gist "aspose-slides" "a1b0b7f99c2b44d84c6d" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-slides-examples-Slides-Shapes-AddingAnOLEObjectFrameToASlide-AddingAnOLEObjectFrameToASlide.java" >}}


The above code snippet adds an**OLE Object Frame** to a slide as shown below in the figure:

|![todo:image_alt_text](http://i.imgur.com/xCIIi5m.jpg)|

### **Accessing an OLE Object Frame from the Slide**
If an OLE object is already embedded in a slide, you can access that object easily using Aspose.Slides for Java. Please follow the steps below to find or access an OLE object from a slide:

- Create an instance of [Presentation](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/classes/Presentation) class.
- Obtain the reference of a slide by using its Index.
- Access the OLE Object Frame shape (in this example, we have used the PPTX created above which has only one shape at first slide) and typecast that object as an OLE Object Frame. This was the desired OLE Object Frame to be accessed.
- Once the OLE Object Frame is accessed, you can perform any operation on it.

In the example given below, an **OLE Object Frame** (that is a **Microsoft Excel Chart** object embedded in a slide) is accessed and then all of its **Object Data** is written to an Excel file.

{{< gist "aspose-slides" "a1b0b7f99c2b44d84c6d" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-slides-examples-Slides-Shapes-AccessingAnOLEObjectFrameFromASlide-AccessingAnOLEObjectFrameFromASlide.java" >}}
### **Set File Type for an Embedding Object**
Using Aspose.Slides for Java you can set file type for an embedding object. For this purpose, new methods **addOleObjectFrame** and **insertOleObjectFrame** have been added into **IShapeCollection**.

These methods allow to get **IOleEmbeddedDataInfo** object as a parameter so now OLE object knows its type and PowerPoint can open created OLE objects.

The following example shows how to set file type for an embedding object:

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "1f55f0222bc39a382d831900e8de7400" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-slides-examples-Slides-Shapes-SetFileTypeForAnEmbeddingObject-SetFileTypeForAnEmbeddingObject.java" >}}


### **Extract Embedded Files from OLE Object**
Aspose.Slides for Java supports extracting embedded files from OLE Object. In order to extract embedded files, please follow the steps below:

- Create an instance ofÂ [Presentation](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/slides/com.aspose.slides/presentation)Â class and Load a presentation contains OLE Object
- Loop through all the shapes in a presentation and access the OLE Object Frame shape
- Access the data of the Embedded file from OLE Object Frame and write it to disk

The implementation of the above steps is demonstrated in the example below.

All demos provided with Aspose.Slides for JasperReports are changed standard demos. It’s better to copy all demos to the JasperReports demo folder:
...\jasperreports-2.0.5\demo\samples\

Use standard commands sequence to build and export reports:

- ant javac
- ant compile
- ant fill
- ant ppt

Please do not forget to run HSQLDB with the test database to fill the reports with data.

Most demos (except Charts) already have generated presentations so you can skip all “ant” steps and check the results immediately.
